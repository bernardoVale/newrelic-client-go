The New Relic Client provides the building blocks for tools in the [Developer Toolkit](https://newrelic.github.io/developer-toolkit/), enabling quick access to the suite of New Relic APIs. As a library, it can also be leveraged within your own custom applications.

## Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"

	"github.com/newrelic/newrelic-client-go/newrelic"
	"github.com/newrelic/newrelic-client-go/pkg/entities"
)

func main() {
	// Initialize the client.
	client, err := newrelic.New(newrelic.ConfigPersonalAPIKey(os.Getenv("NEW_RELIC_API_KEY")))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("error initializing client:", err)
	}

	// Search the current account for entities by name and type.
	searchParams := entities.SearchEntitiesParams{
		Name: "Example entity",
		Type: entities.EntityTypes.Application,
	}

	entities, err := client.Entities.SearchEntities(searchParams)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("error searching entities:", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", entities)
}
```

## Development

### Requirements

* Go 1.13.0+
* GNU Make
* git


### Building

This package does not generate any direct usable assets (it's a library).  You can still run the build scripts to validate you code, and generate coverage information.

```
# Default target is 'build'
$ make

# Explicitly run build
$ make build

# Locally test the CI build scripts
# make build-ci
```


### Testing

Before contributing, all linting and tests must pass.  Tests can be run directly via:

```
# Tests and Linting
$ make test

# Only unit tests
$ make test-unit

# Only integration tests
$ make test-integration
```

### Commit Messages

Using the following format for commit messages allows for auto-generation of
the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md):

#### Format:

`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

| Type | Description | Change log? |
|------| ----------- | :---------: |
| `chore` | Maintenance type work | No |
| `docs` | Documentation Updates | Yes |
| `feat` | New Features | Yes |
| `fix`  | Bug Fixes | Yes |
| `refactor` | Code Refactoring | No |

#### Scope

This refers to what part of the code is the focus of the work.  For example:

**General:**

* `build` - Work related to the build system (linting, makefiles, CI/CD, etc)
* `release` - Work related to cutting a new release

**Package Specific:**

* `newrelic` - Work related to the New Relic package
* `http` - Work related to the `internal/http` package
* `alerts` - Work related to the `pkg/alerts` package


### Documentation

**Note:** This requires the repo to be in your GOPATH [(godoc issue)](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26827)

```
$ make docs
```
